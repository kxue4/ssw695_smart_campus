## Description
This project uses Raspberry Pi's with various sensors to collect data. The data is then stored in a database on premises. The sensors collect temperate, light, air quality, pressure, humidity, and air quality.

For this project, we created a web interface that displays the metrics data in charts, tables, and maps. The goal of the project is to create a smart city proof of concept for the Stevens campus, which provides useful campus information for Stevens students.
